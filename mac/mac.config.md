# Systerm Preferences #

Below you will find my preferred setup of a Mac. What I have noted below is not
necessarily every option that needs to be set, but simply just what I have
different to the default settings.

Each heading represents a different menu in the preferences. The bold
subheadings then refer to any tabs that you may have to look through. The italic
_Uncataegorised_ headings are settings that are not filed away under tabs and
more often then not are simply just at the bottom of the page.
